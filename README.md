# Web Blocker
A lightweight web blocker that blocks certain sites. To modify the blocked sites, edit the hosts file in \resources\replacementfiles. Copy the files to a USB drive and run the setup program. To uninstall it, run the uninstall program. Both programs are in the root of the drive.

NOTE: Our repository is moving to Dropbox. The links will be uploaded in zip files here.
